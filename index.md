Hello! 
This is Erik from the past. I have restarted the Odin Project now at the end of summer and feel ready to embark this journey once more and get further than last time. Since I've already completed this project before, it shouldn't be too difficult to complete, especially considering the fact that I have acquired many more skills throughout the way (compared to last year). I will try to keep this as simple as possible and not try to overcomplicate things...

Tasks: 
1. HTML syntax and outline of website
2. Main content (Google logo + Search bar + Buttons)
3. Header
4. Footer

A couple of hours later, and I now feel finished with my project. I learned some neat little tricks while still enforcing my surface-level knowledge. I still didn't manage to figure out how to import an external CSS document, so I just had inline code. I think that might have to do with me importing the incorrect CSS document, I'll look into it for the next project. 

Tips for future:
1. To align text vertically (center), make the line height the same as the div height :)
2. You can invert the colors of an image (make it from black to white, vice versa) with the filter: invert(100%);
