Hello! 
This is Erik from the past. I have restarted the Odin Project now at the end of summer and feel ready to embark this journey once more and get further than last time. Since I've already completed this project before, it shouldn't be too difficult to complete, especially considering the fact that I have acquired many more skills throughout the way (compared to last year). I will try to keep this as simple as possible and not try to overcomplicate things...

Tasks: 
1. HTML syntax and outline of website
2. Main content (Google logo + Search bar + Recommended sites)
3. Header
